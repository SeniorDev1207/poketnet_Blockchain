# What is Pocketnet?

[Pocketnet](https://pocketnet.app/about) is a decentralized social network based on the blockchain.
There is no central authority or corporation. Platform is run by equal
nodes on a blockchain with no centralized server. All revenue is split
between node operators and content creators. Node operators stake Pocketcoin
in order to mint blocks with rewards and transactions fees. Half of rewards
in each block go to content creators based on ratings their content gathers
from users. [Read more in the article.](https://pocketnet.app/docs/Pocketnet%20Whitepaper%20Draft%20v2.pdf)

# What should I know?
