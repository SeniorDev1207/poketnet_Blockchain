		<div class="p">Free thought and free speech is under attack on mainstream social platforms and in the media. We need to speak the truth and this platform is non-corporate and decentralized for that very reason. But we ask everyone make your point without attacking people's nationality or race. You can make your point based on evidence. We cannot afford to turn <%-app.meta.fullname%> into a marginal platform. Speak the truth, but please avoid racism and attacks against specific nationalities on the whole. We know that Silicon Valley and MSM has turned the issue of racism into their playing card and they constantly cry wolf. Even more the reason for us to be measured and evidence based and not let them smear us with that. If we are not, we are not allowing most of the population to weigh the evidence of MSM corruption presented on <%-app.meta.fullname%>. Please keep that in mind, so that free speech can thrive and we can beat the facebokks of the world.</div>
		<div class="p">Ultimately, it is the community that will determine the direction of the platform. Having a bunch of snowflakes that complain about stuff that offends them is equally as bad as when people want to voice direct violent threats. However, the first indication is that early users of the platform are generally intelligent and evidence based, so the future looks incredibly bright. <%-app.meta.fullname%> team has noticed after a few days of the beta test, that we stopped reading even alternative news, because there was so much interesting content on <%-app.meta.fullname%>. Keep it up!</div>
		<div class="p">Please get involved in the discussion on these topics. This is a community platform. We are always eager to improve transparency of the platform and you should let us know how we can improve our content curation and policing. Use group chat or email support(at)pocketnet*dot*app or make full posts on this topic.</div>
