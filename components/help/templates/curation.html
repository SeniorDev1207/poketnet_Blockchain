		<span>Specifics of curation on Pocketnet.</span>

		<div class="p">When your reputation gets to 100 and you press on dots in the upper right of any post, you will see an option to Complain. If enough Complaints come in, the post will not be shown anymore. When someone has more than 2 posts that are voted off the platform in 24 hours, they cannot post for another 48 hours after the second post. Complain is completed when number of complaints is at least ⅓ of the number of 4 and 5 star ratings, subject to a minimum of 10 complaints (which will be adjusted over time in consultation with the community).</div>
		<div class="p">We are extremely and passionately pro-speech. However, we do not want to turn Pocketnet into a marginal forum where lunatics reign. What would cause you to Complain?</div>
		<div class="p">Do NOT complain about stuff that you simply don’t like or that offends you. That is not a high enough bar. Do not follow people who offend you, soon we will have a feature for not seeing their posts, but do not complain about them. Complain only about things that threaten long term viability of Pocketnet as a mass communication platform that intends to reach to all levels of society in many countries.</div>
		<div class="p">We strongly recommend that you complain about porn of any kind. There are plenty of porn sites on the web, we do not want to mix our free speech endeavor with that. We strongly encourage the community to vote off porn. Secondly, any type of a direct threat should be voted off and clear examples of racism should too. If we allow MSM to tie us to racism or violence directly, Pocketnet will cease to exist before we can even get it out there. Just because MSM media cries wolf about fake racism, doesn’t mean we should prove them right by tolerating it in our platform. It will detract from what we are trying to achieve, which is to challenge new totalitarianism created by the unholy alliance of media, finance and corrupt government officials.</div>
