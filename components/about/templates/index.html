						<div class="slideSubCaption">
							How is Pocketnet different from...
						</div>

						<div class="faqtext">
							<div class="question"><span>Twitter, Facebook, Reddit & other centralized platforms?</span></div>
							<div class="answer">There is no central authority or corporation. Platform is run by equal nodes on a blockchain. All revenue is split between node operators and content creators. Node operators stake Pocketcoin in order to mint blocks with rewards and transactions fees. Half of rewards in each block go to content creators based on ratings their content gathers from users.</div> 
						</div>
						<div class="faqtext">
							<div class="question"><span>Decentralized platforms like Minds.com and Sola?</span></div>
							<div class="answer"> Both of those platforms, while great, are not self-contained. Both are highly dependent on the Ethereum platform, because their tokens are based on ERC-20 Ethereum standard. That means that operations with tokens carry Ether gas fees. Also, those entities have corporations behind them and a corporation will always be a point of centralization due to its economic logic of growing profits. In addition, corporations are exceedingly easy to censor.</div>
						</div>

						<div class="faqtext">
							<div class="question"><span>From Steemit?</span></div>
							<div class="answer"> Steemit has its own blockchain, but is a corporate entity with all of the centralization that comes from that.</div>
						</div>

						<div class="faqtext">
							<div class="question"><span>Decentralized platforms like Mastodon and others?</span></div>
							<div class="answer"> While Mastodon is a fully decentralized platform, it requires a great deal of technical knowledge to use. This presents a great hindrance to potential widespread acceptance. Pocketnet features a web and desktop applications and users can log in from any device, pull in their personal settings from the blockchain and start using the platform immediately without any technial knowledge.</div>
						</div>

							Pocketnet ecosystem
						</div>

						<div class="faqtext">
							<div class="question"><span>How is Pocketnet develpment funded?</span></div>
							<div class="answer"> Pocketnet is open sourced and is currently run by the group of volunteers with some serious programming and math skills. After launch Pocketnet will attract top programming talent based on its promise of creating a decentralized fair social network. Programmers and marketers working on Pocketcoin receive 5% of emission. The awards to developers and marketers will be assigned by nodes voting in a transparent manner.</div>
						</div>
					

						<div class="faqtext">
							<div class="question"><span>What is Pocketcoin?</span></div>
							<div class="answer">Pocketcoin is a network token. It is used exclusively to buy advertising from Pocketnet contributors and to pay transaction fees for such payments. Pocketcoin emission depends on the number of users of Pocketnet and has inherent algorithmic factors tying its long term value to Annual Revenue Per User (ARPU). ARPU is a term in digital advertising which signifies the total amount of revenue platform receives for one active user per year. In Pocketent all of the revenue is split between content creators and nodes.</div>
						</div>

						<div class="faqtext">
							<div class="question"><span>How are content creators and node operators rewarded?</span></div>
							<div class="answer">Pocketnet features unique Direct Marketplace where content creators can sell advertising to ad buyers. Content creators set their price and can accept mass-produced ads or can offer highly valued custom placements (creators pitching the product in their own way). Direct Marketplace is essentially an exchange for advertising that allows ad buyers target specific audiences without any intermediaries. All ad buys and ads themselves are linked on the blockchain, therefore ad buying is completely trustless.</div>
						</div>

						<div class="faqtext">
							<div class="question"><span>What if users post illegal content, pornography and SPAM?</span></div>
							<div class="answer">Pocketnet is not a darknet platform or some sort of pornhub. While it is decentralized and censorship resistant, it is policed by the users. Any illegal content is flagged and removed from the platform using the Wikipedia model. This means that users with highest reputation can police the platform. However, there are safeguards in place (within the open source code) from same or very similar group(s) of people repeatedly voting content off the platform. Also, users are explicitly encouraged to flag only illegal content, not simply the content they find offensive. To make sure that Pocketnet is a free speech platform, we encourage you to start participate, grow your reputation and police the platform properly without the censorship currently prevalent in centralized social media.</div>
