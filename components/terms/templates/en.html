You may initiate trades ("trades" or "contacts") by contacting available offers created by other users or wait for users to initiate a trade with you by contacting you directly through an offer that you have publicly posted. When you start a cryptocurrency transaction you agree to be bound by the advertisers terms of trade ("advertiser’s terms") set forth by the advertiser and displayed as terms of trade on the offer page. The validity of the terms of trade as determined by the advertiser remain valid and intact unless they contradict the Terms of Service set forth by Getbitcoins.io, are illegal or if both parties agree upon changing the terms. The price or price equation that is defined in the offer must contain any and all fees that are required to be paid by the user in accordance with the terms of the advertiser.
